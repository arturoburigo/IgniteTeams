# About the project 
<p>I have developed an application that enables users to create and manage groups, facilitating team division and organization.
  Users can easily create, edit, and delete these groups, while also adding or removing participants with ease. 
  This app simplifies the process of group management and fosters efficient collaboration among team members.<p/>
